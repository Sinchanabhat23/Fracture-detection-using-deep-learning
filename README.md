# Fracture Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Fracture Detection System** is a machine learning–based application that helps in detecting bone fractures from X-ray images. The system uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to classify X-ray images as **fractured** or **non-fractured**. This project is designed to assist medical professionals by providing faster and more accurate preliminary fracture detection.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Collect X-ray image dataset
2. Preprocess images (resizing, normalization, noise removal)
3. Train CNN model on processed images
4. Test and validate model performance
5. Upload new X-ray image for prediction
6. Display result as fractured or non-fractured
